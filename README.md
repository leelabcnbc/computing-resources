## cluster and ML documentation

A PDF overview (and the TeX source that generates it, with embedded files) of
cluster usage, basic PyTorch info, and neural response modeling is now
available. The older tutorials from Yimeng still may be useful, but some
material might be out of date, and they're organized differently.

[![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter.png)](https://gitter.im/cnbc-computing-resources)

* `tutorials` contains recipes for performing specific tasks on the cluster.
* `modules` contains detailed explanations for individual programs, pacakges, etc.

## tutorials
* Read [jupyter_quickstart](./tutorials/jupyter_quickstart.md) to access jupyter notebook using the cluster

## modules
* Installing [miniconda](./modules/miniconda.md), as well as tmux
* Installing [python](./modules/python.md) and basic packages
* Using [Jupyter Notebook](./modules/jupyter.md)
* Installing [deep learning frameworks](./modules/deep_learning.md)

## where to report problems

### everyday usage

please click the badge in the top to chat via Gitter. You can use it as long as you have an Twitter or GitHub account.

### serious issues, such as broken hardware.

Please email Dave (`dpane@cmu.edu`) for all issues. If you have a SCS account due to being affiliated with the SCS department, you may also cc `help@cs.cmu.edu`.

Please review the twiki (<http://twiki.cnbc.cmu.edu>) about the policies, specifically:
Cluster Usage Policies section & User Support section on (<http://twiki.cnbc.cmu.edu/do/view/CnbcUsers/ClusterPolicies>)  

For GPU related issues, it maybe also good to cc Ed (`ewalter@cs.cmu.edu`) as well.
