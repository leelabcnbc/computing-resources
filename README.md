## where to report problems

Please email Dave (`dpane@cmu.edu`) (for all issues), cc'ing `help@cs.cmu.edu` (don't cc'ing if you are responsible for the issue. THIS IS IMPORTANT).

Don't know whether you should be responsible for the issue? 
Please review the twiki (<http://twiki.cnbc.cmu.edu>) about the policies, specifically:
Cluster Usage Policies section & User Support section on (<http://twiki.cnbc.cmu.edu/do/view/CnbcUsers/ClusterPolicies>)  

For GPU related issues, it maybe also good to cc Ed (`ewalter@cs.cmu.edu`) as well.
